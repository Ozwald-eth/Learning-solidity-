# Learning-solidity-
Im starting my adventure of solidity as a complete noobie ... my largest experience in coding would be basic html webpages with ccs functions!

My primary interest is currently tracking the crypto markets and learning about blockchains. While my theory knowledge of blockchains is one of my largest prides, it does me a diservice to not know how to create contracts and such utilising the EVM. 

For this reason i have chosen solidity as my starting place.
